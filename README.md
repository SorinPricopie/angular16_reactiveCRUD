Welcome to my Reactive CRUD Angular 16 project!

What can you find here?
- routing with lazy loading, CanActivate & CanDeactivate guards;
- angular-in-memory-web-api to mock backend;
- rxjs for reactive CRUD operations with async pipe and minimal subscribes;
- vanila scss for styling;
- reactive forms with default & custom validations;

For sure, there is a lot of room for improvement, but this project is mainly designed for reactive CRUD operations.
Thank you, happy coding!
